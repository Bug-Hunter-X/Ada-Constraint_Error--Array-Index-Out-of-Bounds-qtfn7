# Ada Constraint_Error: Array Index Out of Bounds

This repository demonstrates a common Ada programming error: accessing an array element using an index that is outside the defined bounds of the array.  This results in a `Constraint_Error` exception being raised.

The `bug.ada` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.ada` file shows how to prevent this error by properly checking the index bounds before accessing the array.
